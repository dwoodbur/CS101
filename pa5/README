Assignment 5 README File
Dylan Woodbury

Contained are the following files:
	-shortestPath.c
	-Graph.c
	-Graph.h
	-GraphDriver.c
	-List.c
	-List.h
	-ListDriver.c
	-Makefile
	-README

I ran it on tests including up to 10 000, which it ran
well at, at a quick speed it seemed.

TO USE
"make" makes the following:
	-shortestDriver
		Run with "shortestDriver [text file]".
	-GraphDriver
		Runs specific trials with the Graph ADT.
	-ListDriver
		Runs specific trials with the List ADT.
