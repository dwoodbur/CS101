Data for sortComp Tests
			
sort alg	100	1000	10000	100000
heap		0	0	.38	38.86001
		-	-	.39	38.41
		-	-	.39	38.61999
insertion	0	0	.11	10.75
		-	-	.10	10.69
		-	-	.11	10.75

Given the results, it is obvious that my implementations of the
insertion sort runs more efficiently than the heap sort. Results
also scale X100 for X10 size, implying O(n^2) growth.
