When you 'make', all warnings are about unused parameter variables,
little things that shouldn't matter with the djb2 algorithm, etc.

To run a driver program after 'make', just enter one of the
driver executable names.

To run the main program, enter 'findBooks' followed by a proper
library input file and a proper request input file.
Library/book pairs are inserted into the hash table, which
contains the key of the book title and a list of library IDs.

Thanks for grading!
